# If the board module exists on the pyboard (i.e. a file named board.py somewhere in the module search path)
# and it contains an attribute called name (e.g. name = "myboard") then the pyboard will use that name.

# This makes the board name as esp8266.
# So, the filesystem can be accessed like /esp8266/
name="esp8266"
